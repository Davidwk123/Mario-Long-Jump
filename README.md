# Mario-Long-Jump

Part of the movement mechanic in most 3D Mario games Developed with Unreal Engine 5.
But have been refrencing the mechanic specifically from Super Mario 3D World.

Attempted to develop Mario's long jump, the long jump is triggered by moving, pressing the crouch button, and then the jump button.

Used Unreal Engine's third person project framework.

Used delgoodie's Character Movement Component series as a guide to implement the custom crouch/long jump fuctionality: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXJlkahwiwPmeABEhjwIALvxRSZkzoQpk
